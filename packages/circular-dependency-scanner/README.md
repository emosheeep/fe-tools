Out-of-box circular dependencies detector, with both JavaScript API and Command Line Tool built in, support all file types we used in common like `.js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx,.mjs,.cjs,.vue`.

Pull out `import/require/export` path from files and revert it into to real path (if aliased) with path alias configurations, then calculate the circles among and print which with colors.

# Features

- üì¶ All file types support.
- üí° Friendly Command Line Tool.
- üõ†Ô∏è Fully Typed JavaScript APIs and Prompts.
- üå© Tiny, Pretty, Fast and Reliable.

# Example

Here the running example for the `ds -o circles.json` execution:

![cli.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emosheeep/fe-tools/HEAD/packages/circular-dependency-scanner/snapshots/cli.gif)

The `ts,js,vue` files will be printed directly into console as `blue,yellow,green` as follows if you didn't pass an output filename param:

# Motivation

On one hand there are few tools, on the other hand there are too many annoyed problems among the exist tools on the market:

1. Not reliable, **usually missed lots of dep-circles**. This is because in common they can't pull out the import/require sources correctly from source files
2. Not a standalone tool, they often appears as a webpack/rollup/vite plugin, and analyze the relations with help of the module graph created by the plugin's host, which usually under limitations, slow and hard to use.

But now, you just run `ds`, all of the **(.js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx,.mjs,.cjs,.vue)** files under current directory will be parsed directly and fast with TypeScript API, which almost include all file types we used. And then the circles among these files will be printed.

# Command Line Tool (Prefer)

The `ds` command which means `depscan` will be available after you installed this package globally.

```sh
pnpm i -g circular-dependency-scanner # or npm/yarn
cd path/to/execute # change directory
ds # run `ds` command
```

There are detailed documentations built in, you can use `-h` option to print help information anytime.

```sh
ds [options] [path] # Automatically detect circular dependencies under the current directory and print the circles.
```

## Options

```sh
ds -h # print help info
ds -V/--version # print cli version

ds # current dir by default
ds src # detect src directory...and so on.
ds --filter 'src/router/*.ts' # only print the circles matched the pattern.
ds --absolute # print absolute path.
ds --ignore output dist node_modules # path to ignore.
ds --output circles.json # output analysis into specified file.
ds --alias @:src @components:src/components # path alias, follows `<from>:<to>` convention.
ds --throw # exit with code 1 when cycles're found.
```

# JavaScript API

Sometime you may want to manually write script and make an analysis, just use JavaScript API as follows:

```ts
import { circularDepsDetect } from 'circular-dependency-scanner';

const results = circularDepsDetect({
  /**
   * Base path to execute command.
   * @default process.cwd()
   */
  cwd: string;
  /**
   * Whether to use absolute path.
   * @default false
   */
  absolute: boolean;
  /**
   * Glob patterns to exclude from matches.
   * @default ['node_modules']
   */
  ignore: string[];
  /**
   * Path alias to resolve.
   * @default { '@': 'src' }
   */
  alias: Record<string, string>;
});

```

# QA

## Which reference will be pull out from the files

This source code is here [src/ast.ts](https://github.com/emosheeep/fe-tools/blob/HEAD/packages/circular-dependency-scanner/src/ast.ts). In a short, it find reference like: 

```ts
import test from './test'; // got './test'
import './test'; // got './test'
import('./test'); // got './test'
require('./test'); // got './test'
export * from './test'; // got './test'
export { test }; // got no export source
```

If some of the circles it found make no sense, you can use `--filter` option to screen out.

## Running at monorepo

The analysis of file reference depend on the `alias` configurations you have supplied. So if you run this command at your monorepo root directory, you may find that some of the different projects under may include same alias configurations, which cause the results unreliable.

**If you want to analyze multiple projects, please execute one by one**.

# Reference

- The Command Line Tool is based on [commander](https://github.com/tj/commander.js).
- The circular dependencies analysis algorithm is based on [graph-cycles](https://github.com/grantila/graph-cycles).
